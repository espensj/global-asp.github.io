    <p>Below are a series of guidelines for recording audio, developed during the process of creating <a href="https://global-asp.github.io/audio/">freely-licensed audio versions</a> of multilingual stories from the <a href="http://africanstorybook.org/">African Storybook</a> and <a href="https://global-asp.github.io/">Global African Storybook Project</a> collections.</p></td>

    <ul>
      <li>Reading at length can be dry and thirsty work – try to provide ample water for readers before and after the recording session</li>
      <li>Provide the stories to readers in advance of the recording day, to allow them time to read through them and prepare
        <ul>
          <li>Ask them to note any words they are unsure of (pronunciation, names, etc), as well as errors in the text, so that they can be addressed and corrected before recording</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Prepare a text file, PDF, or printout containing the text of all stories in sequence
        <ul>
          <li>If you are providing an electronic version of the script for the recording session, it might also be a good idea to prepare a mouse with a middle scroll button, or a trackpad or other device that can be scrolled silently during the recording with breaking flow or losing position</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Test the microphone in advance, and then again after being adjusted for the reader
        <ul>
          <li>Specifically ask readers to read out loud a short sentence or two containing a variety of <a href="https://www.videomaker.com/article/c4/14106-plosives-and-sibilance">sibilants</a> or <a href="http://transom.org/2016/p-pops-plosives/">plosives</a> (e.g. /s/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/, /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/ etc), such as the following:
            <ul>
              <li>“She sells sea-shells on the sea-shore…”</li>
              <li>“Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers…”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If this produces unwanted hissing or popping noises on playback, then adjust the microphone placement or experiment with one of the many ways of making a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Pop-Filter">DIY pop filter</a> to reduce the noise</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Try to eliminate sources of ambient noise (fans, vents, machinery etc) or find a quiet location or studio space to record if possible
        <ul>
          <li>Be particularly aware of traffic noise which may occur at irregular intervals and be heard through windows etc even if they are closed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
